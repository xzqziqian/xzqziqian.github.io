### Research Interest 

My name is Ziqian, I'm currently a quantitative psychology PhD student at University of Notre Dame. I am interested in network data analysis and longitudinal data analysis. Most of my work in these fields can be found on my [github page](https://github.com/iasnobmatsu) and on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziqian-Xu-10). I would also love to learn more about data visualization and machine learning techniques. 



### Things I Enjoy Outside of Research

- I like anime and I was into Jpop a long time ago.
- I like music and I collect vinyls. The most recent one I obtained is Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.
- I aspire to exercise and build a strong body.


### 研究方向

我主要关注网络数据分析和纵向数据分析，相关的研究工作大多可以在我的 [GitHub](https://github.com/iasnobmatsu) 页面 和 [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziqian-Xu-10) 上找到。我也希望能继续学习更多关于数据可视化和机器学习的方法与技术。
